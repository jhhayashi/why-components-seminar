# Backend
This is the backend and database for the why comoponents seminar example. The database is just an array in memory that deletes when the server stops or restarts.

## Installation
Build and start the server by running `npm run build && npm start` (or `yarn build && yarn start` if you're into that).

I didn't use any fancy ES6 goodies, so this should work on any node version.

## Development
Pull requests welcome! I just ask that you use ES5 syntax to maintain compatibility with all node versions.
